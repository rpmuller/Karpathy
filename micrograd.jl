# # Karpathy NN Zero to Hero

# I'm going to attempt to redo (some of?) Karpathy's 
# [Neural Nets: Zero to Hero](https://github.com/karpathy/nn-zero-to-hero)
# tutorials in Julia. 
#
# Why rewrite? I've worked through much of this in Python, and seeing how things 
# are different in another language, perhaps without the crutch of using pytorch, 
# will make me learn the theory more deeply.
#
# Why Julia? It's fast, elegant, and just as readable as Python. (Although switching 
# back and forth between the two often leaves me forgetting which language I'm using 
# and how to do the most basic things.)
#
# There's a lot of work going on to rewrite everything in C to have fast code and simple 
# access to GPUs. A lot of this could just as easily be done in Julia and produce easier 
# to understand code that will (hopefully) be just as fast.

# Understanding derivatives, creating functions, plotting them.

# Julia has a nice syntax for creating functions in one line.
f(x) = 3*x^2 -4*x + 5
f(3)
f(3.0)
# These are (intentionally) type vague for now, so calling with an int returns an int, 
# and calling with a float returns a float.

# Compute (numerical) derivatives of function
h = 0.00001
x = 2/3
(f(x+h)-f(x))/h
